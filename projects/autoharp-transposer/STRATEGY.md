Strategy

Multi-Agent Development Strategy for Autoharp Transposer
Based on my analysis of your codebase, here's a comprehensive strategy for dividing work among multiple LLM agents to ensure bug-free, parallel development:

üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Overview
Your codebase already has excellent modular separation with 8 core modules:

InputManager - Handles chord input and validation
ChordParser - Parses and normalizes chord strings
EventCoordinator - Manages UI events and user interactions
StateManager - Manages application state
StorageManager - Handles data persistence
ChordAudioManager - Audio playback functionality
IntegrationBridge - Legacy system integration
AppIntegration - Main application controller
üéØ Agent Division Strategy
Agent 1: Chord Logic Specialist
Responsibility: Core chord transposition and music theory

Files: 
chordParser.js
, chord validation logic
Tasks:
Implement autoharp-specific chord mappings
Create transposition algorithms (key changes, capo simulation)
Build chord compatibility matrices for different autoharp types
Validate chord progressions for musical correctness
Agent 2: Input & UI Specialist
Responsibility: User interface and input handling

Files: 
inputManager.js
, 
eventCoordinator.js
, 
webapp.html
, 
webapp.css
Tasks:
Enhance chord input methods (text, buttons, drag-drop)
Build autoharp type selector interface
Create progression visualization components
Implement real-time input validation and suggestions
Agent 3: State & Data Specialist
Responsibility: Application state and data management

Files: 
stateManager.js
, 
storageManager.js
Tasks:
Design state schema for autoharp types and progressions
Implement undo/redo functionality
Create session persistence and project saving
Build export/import functionality for progressions
Agent 4: Audio & Feedback Specialist
Responsibility: Audio playback and user feedback

Files: chordAudioManager.js, audio-related components
Tasks:
Implement chord playback for different autoharp types
Create audio previews of transposed progressions
Build metronome and tempo control
Design visual feedback for chord changes
Agent 5: Integration & Testing Specialist
Responsibility: System integration and quality assurance

Files: 
appIntegration.js
, 
integrationBridge.js
, test files
Tasks:
Coordinate module integration
Create comprehensive test suites
Handle error management and edge cases
Implement performance optimization


üîß Coordination Protocols
1. Interface Contracts
Each agent must define clear interfaces for their modules:

javascript
// Example: ChordParser interface
class ChordParser {
  transposeProgression(chords, fromKey, toKey, autoharpType) {}
  validateChordForHarp(chord, autoharpType) {}
  getSuggestedAlternatives(chord, autoharpType) {}
}
2. Shared Data Schemas
Define common data structures all agents must follow:

javascript
// Autoharp Type Schema
{
  id: "15-chord-chromatic",
  name: "15-Chord Chromatic",
  availableChords: ["C", "F", "G", ...],
  keySignatures: ["C", "G", "D", ...],
  difficulty: "beginner"
}

// Chord Progression Schema
{
  id: "prog-001",
  name: "Basic I-V-vi-IV",
  originalKey: "C",
  chords: [{chord: "C", beats: 4}, ...],
  autoharpType: "15-chord-chromatic"
}
3. Development Phases
Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)

Agent 1: Basic chord parsing and validation
Agent 2: Core UI components and input handling
Agent 3: Basic state management structure
Agent 4: Audio system initialization
Agent 5: Test framework setup
Phase 2: Core Features (Sequential Dependencies)

Agent 1: Transposition algorithms ‚Üí Agent 3: State integration
Agent 2: Autoharp selector ‚Üí Agent 1: Chord compatibility
Agent 4: Audio playback ‚Üí Agent 1: Chord data
Agent 5: Integration testing of Phase 1 components
Phase 3: Advanced Features (Parallel)

Agent 1: Advanced music theory features
Agent 2: Enhanced UI/UX features
Agent 3: Advanced data management
Agent 4: Audio effects and visualization
Agent 5: Performance optimization and edge case handling
üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance Strategy
1. Mandatory Testing Protocol
Each agent must:

Write unit tests for their modules
Create integration test scenarios
Follow the existing test structure in /tests/ folder
Update the knowledge graph after changes
2. Code Review Checkpoints
Daily: Interface compliance verification
Weekly: Cross-module integration testing
Milestone: Full system integration testing
3. Conflict Prevention
Naming conventions: Use module prefixes for methods
File ownership: Clear ownership of each file by agent
Communication log: Document all interface changes
Dependency tracking: Maintain dependency graphs
üìã Implementation Checklist
Before Starting:
 All agents review existing codebase and knowledge graph
 Define and agree on all interface contracts
 Set up shared data schemas
 Establish communication protocols
During Development:
 Run node codebase-mapper.js after any changes
 Test individual modules before integration
 Document all public methods and interfaces
 Follow existing code patterns and conventions
Integration Points:
 Verify all modules load correctly
 Test data flow between modules
 Validate UI responds to all user actions
 Confirm audio playback works with transposed chords
 Test persistence and state management
üéØ Success Metrics
Zero duplicate methods (verified by duplicate detection tools)
100% test coverage for core functionality
Sub-100ms response time for chord transposition
Error-free integration between all modules
Comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces
This strategy leverages your existing modular architecture while ensuring clear separation of concerns and minimal conflicts between agents. Each agent has distinct responsibilities but clear integration points, enabling parallel development while maintaining code quality.
