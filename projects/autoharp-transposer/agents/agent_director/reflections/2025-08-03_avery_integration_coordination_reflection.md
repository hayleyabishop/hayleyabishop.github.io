# Director Reflection - Avery Integration Task Coordination

## **Situation Analysis:**
Agent 4 (Avery) has completed their audio and visual feedback modules and provided specific integration requirements for the other agents. This represents a critical milestone where completed modules need to be integrated with the rest of the system.

## **Coordination Decisions Made:**

### **1. Task Prioritization:**
- **Critical Priority:** Agent 5 (Tessa) module initialization - Must happen first
- **High Priority:** Agent 2 (Inigo) UI event binding and Agent 3 (Stacy) state management
- **Medium Priority:** Agent 1 (Chloe) transposition preview integration

### **2. Dependency Management:**
- Identified that Agent 5 must initialize modules before other integrations can occur
- Recognized that all agents need access to Avery's completed modules
- Planned sequential integration to avoid conflicts

### **3. Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk:** Agent 4's modules are complete and tested
- **Medium Risk:** Integration points may require debugging
- **High Risk:** Potential for duplicate method issues during integration

## **Strategic Approach:**
Rather than having all agents work simultaneously, I've planned a phased approach:
1. Foundation (Agent 5 initialization)
2. Core integrations (Agents 2 & 3)
3. Enhancement features (Agent 1)
4. Comprehensive testing

## **Communication Protocol:**
- Logged Avery's requirements as formal instruction
- Created detailed task assignments with code examples
- Established clear success metrics and timeline
- Prepared for coordination with each specialist agent

## **Next Steps:**
- Monitor Agent 5 (Tessa) for module initialization completion
- Coordinate with Agent 2 (Inigo) and Agent 3 (Stacy) for their integration tasks
- Ensure Agent 1 (Chloe) is ready for transposition preview integration
- Plan comprehensive integration testing phase

## **Lessons Learned:**
- Clear, specific integration requirements from completed agents enable efficient coordination
- Sequential integration reduces risk of conflicts
- Detailed code examples in task assignments improve implementation accuracy

This coordination approach should ensure smooth integration of Avery's audio/visual feedback system with the rest of the autoharp transposer webapp.
